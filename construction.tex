\section{Construction}

Our proposed protocol is not very different from the existing Bitcoin Backbone
protocol, with the notable exception that it makes use of our functionality
from Section~\ref{sec.functionality}. The proof-of-work is performed by invoking
the $\mine$ method as seen in Algorithm~\ref{alg.pow}. Once the tip of a chain
is known, the whole chain can be retrieved as seen in
Algorithm~\ref{alg.getchain} (the functionality ensures that knowing a child
implies knowing its parent).

The full honest algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm~\ref{alg.round}. Each
honest party locally maintains a (finite) chain $\chain$, which it extends by
mining on top of it. If mining is successful, they $\broadcast$ the newly
discovered block to the network. Additionally, if they change their adopted
chain, they also broadcast it to the network. Finally, they receive newly
discovered blocks from the previous round using $\getmail$ and adopt the longest
chain on the network as long as it is better than the local chain.
