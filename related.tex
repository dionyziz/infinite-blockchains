The formal treatment of polynomial executions of blockchain protocols based on
proof-of-work~\cite{C:DwoNao92} was first put forth in Bitcoin
Backbone~\cite{EC:GarKiaLeo15} and the follow-up work which deals with variable
difficulty~\cite{C:GarKiaLeo17}; the backbone papers put forth the Chain Growth, Common Prefix,
and Chain Quality properties, which we adapt to the infinite setting in
the present work. The backbone protocol has been extended to the
semi-synchronous setting~\cite{EC:PasSeeShe17} and has been precisely modelled
in the UC framework as a ledger
functionality~\cite{EPRINT:BMTZ17,badertscher2018ouroboros}. The anonymous
byzantine agreement problem was studied by~\cite{okun2008efficient}. To our
knowledge, there have been no studies of blockchain protocols in the
unbounded-time setting.
