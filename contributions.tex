\textbf{Contributions.}
In this paper, we make the following key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We extend the treatment of blockchain protocols from the
        polynomially-bound setting to the unbounded setting.
  \item We prove that chains in infinite executions realize the familiar
        finite-blockchain properties, namely Chain Growth, Common Prefix, and
        Chain Quality, for which we give definitional extensions.
  \item We show that infinite executions of blockchain protocols give rise to
        infinite ledgers which retain the familiar properties of Liveness and
        Persistence.
  \item We put forth the unbounded treatment as a methodology for a simple first
        evaluation of new protocols. Our thesis is that, using this methodology,
        a protocol can be evaluated and fine-tuned, and potential attacks can be
        discovered, prior to marching into a detailed treatment in polynomial
        time.
\end{itemize}
